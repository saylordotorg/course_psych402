**Unit 5: The Sensory Systems** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will explore the sensory system, a part of the nervous system
that enables us to receive stimuli from the environment around us and
conduct this information to the brain for processing.The sensory system
enables us to taste, smell, hear, feel, and see sensory stimuli *– *and
without these functions, we would have minimal interaction with the
world around us.As such, our sensory systems are integral to daily
functioning. This unit will introduce you to each of the different
sensory systems, identifying the organization, function, and methods of
information transduction for each.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 17 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.4: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.5: 3 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   define the general principles of sensory reception, transduction,
    and cortical transmission;
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    visual system;
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    auditory system;
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    haptic system;
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    gustatory system;
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    olfactory system; and 
-   describe reception, transduction, and cortical transmission in the
    vestibular system.
