**Unit 6: The Motor System** <span id="6"></span> 
*Physical movement of any sort is a complex act requiring the seamless
coordination of multiple body systems. Considering the millions of ways
in which your body moves on a daily basis, the motor system may well be
one of the most complex systems in the body. In this unit, we will study
this system, exploring the ways it controls different movements and
identifying the areas of the brain that participate in that process.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.4: 3 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   describe the neural systems and structures involved in the
    initiation of movement;
-   describe the neural systems and structures involved in planning and
    coordinating sequences of movement;
-   describe the role of the brainstem structures in motor control; and
-   describe the pathways of communication between the CNS and
    peripheral motor systems via the spinal cord.
