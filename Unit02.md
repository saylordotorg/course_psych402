**Unit 2: The Organization of the Nervous System** <span id="2"></span> 
*The structure of the nervous system is extremely complex, in part
because we have had to devise ways to refer to specific parts of it
while excluding others, which has led to complicated naming conventions
and systems of reference. For example, a psychologist may want to
discuss a certain area of the brain independently of the rest of the
brain *– *and then discuss it in reference to another part of the
brain *– *and experts have devised distinct ways to reference both. In
this unit, we will discuss the structure of the nervous system by taking
a look at its subsystems and identifying the ways in which they connect
to one another. Though you may find this unit dense and jargon-heavy,
you will need to be familiar with the terminology introduced here
throughout the remainder of the course.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   define the anatomical terms of direction;
-   describe the basic structure and organization of the nervous system;
-   describe how the spinal cord transmits and receives neural
    information;
-   define the three primary anatomical areas of the brain; and
-   describe how each side of the body is controlled by the opposite
    side of the brain.
