Course Syllabus for "PSYCH402: Neuropsychology"
-----------------------------------------------

How does the brain function? How does it interact with the body in order
to control and mediate behaviors and actions? Though psychologists have
long studied these questions, the workings of the brain remain, in large
part, a mystery. In this course, we will explore the field of psychology
devoted to the pursuit of these questions: neuropsychology or the study
of the structure and function of the brain as it relates to
psychological processes. We will study significant findings in the
field, noting that technological improvements have often enabled
substantial advancements in field research. You may, for example, take
MRIs or PET scans – devices used to diagnose medical problems – for
granted, but these have only relatively recently enabled researchers to
study the brain in greater detail. While a formal background in biology
is not required for this course, you will find that neuropsychology
relies heavily on the discipline. In fact, psychologists and biologists
have often explored similar issues, though typically from vastly
different perspectives. Accordingly, you may find supplemental biology
materials useful if you are entirely unfamiliar with the brain and the
nervous system. This course will begin with a brief history of
neuropsychology. We will then study the nervous system and the structure
of the brain, identifying its different lobes and cortices, before
concluding with a discussion of how the brain provides us with higher
functioning abilities (i.e., learning, remembering, and communicating).

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   explain the development course of the science of neuropsychology;
-   describe the basic organization of the nervous system;
-   explain the mechanisms of communication within the nervous system;
-   explain the mechanisms of communication between the nervous system
    and other parts of the body;
-   describe historical and modern research techniques for investigating
    nervous system structure and function;
-   describe the basic operation of each of the five (5) primary sensory
    systems;
-   describe the basic operation of the motor system;
-   discuss the importance and role of asymmetry in cerebral structure
    and function;
-   describe the basic functions of each of the four (4) lobes of the
    cerebral cortex; and
-   discuss the neuropsychology of higher behavioral functions, such as
    language, emotion, learning, and consciousness.
