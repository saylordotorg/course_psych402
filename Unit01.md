**Unit 1: The Development of Neuropsychology** <span id="1"></span> 
*Although neurospsychology is relatively new as a formal discipline, the
brain and its mysterious functioning have prompted study and
investigation since ancient Greece. It is only recently, however, that
we have begun to study the brain scientifically. This unit will review
the origins of neuropsychology as a scientific practice and introduce
its principal concepts and theories.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 3 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   distinguish between the central and peripheral nervous systems;
-   describe gross brain anatomy;
-   describe the basic interactions between the central and peripheral
    nervous systems;
-   define and provide examples of materialism;
-   define and provide examples of Cartesian dualism;
-   describe the mind-body problem;
-   describe the development of localization of function within the
    brain;

**1.1.3 Aristotle and the Mind vs. Descartes and the Mind-Body Dualism**
<span id="1.1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Information Philosopher: “History of the Problem of
    Knowledge”**
    Link: The Information Philosopher: [“History of the Problem of
    Knowledge”](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/knowledge/history/)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article to learn about how early
    philosophical works handled the problem of knowledge, or
    epistemology, especially proving that knowledge is possible. Read
    about fundamental philosophers such as the Sophists, Plato, and
    Socrates, and apply that foundation to the distinction between
    Aristotle and Descartes. Note Aristotle’s view that all things are a
    combination of form and matter and understanding how physical things
    change is just as important as their essence vs. Descartes’ view
    that knowledge is subjective and the focus should be on internal
    thoughts instead of the external world. Key concepts such as *a
    priori*, dialectical, sophistical, foundationalism, and internalism
    will help distinguish between Aristotle and Descartes’ views.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.
