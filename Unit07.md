**Unit 7: Cerebral Asymmetry** <span id="7"></span> 
*You may know that the brain is comprised of two hemispheres, the left
and the right. You may not know that these two sides function
independently of each other in certain ways. Though we are not fully
aware of the reasons for this asymmetry, psychologists believe that an
understanding of the laterallyspecific functions that each performs will
further assist us in our quest to know how the brain controls certain
behaviors. When we use the term “laterallyspecific,” we refer to those
functions controlled by only one hemisphere. For example, we know that
the left hemisphere fully controls the exercise of language. However,
information generated by laterallyspecific functions is often shared
with the other hemisphere. In fact, we frequently need the hemispheres
to exchange laterallyspecific information in order to react
appropriately. This unit will discuss these and other matters pertaining
to the hemispheres and their respective functions.*
