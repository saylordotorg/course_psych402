**Unit 3: Neurons, Neurotransmitters, and Receptors** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Now that you are familiar with the structure of the brain, you will
learn how it works. We will begin with tbe building blocks of brain
functionality: neurons, or brain cells responsible for the transmission
of information from one cell to another. We will then take a look at how
cells in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system function
in order to better understand the way in which information is
transmitted throughout our bodies. You will also learn how electrical
activity enables the transmission of neural information, discussing the
roles that neurotransmitters and receptors play in this process.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 13hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 3 hours

 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.5: 2 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   describe the basic structure and function of a nerve cell;
-   describe the electrical properties of neural function;
-   describe the basic means of interneural communication;
-   describe the most important neurotransmitters and their functions;
    and
-   describe the basic neuroreceptor types.
