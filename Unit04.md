**Unit 4: Methods for Studying Brain Function** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit will focus on the different brain technologies and techniques
that have been developed to facilitate the study of brain
functioning. You will learn that the development of these technologies
(which include MRIs, PETs, and EEGs) has greatly advanced the field of
neuropsychology, enabling researchers to collect crucial and
groundbreaking information about the brain and its processes.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 3 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   define the most common techniques for recording electrical signals
    from the brain;
-   describe the most common methods of obtaining images of brain
    structures;
-   describe the most common techniques for obtaining data on brain
    functions; and
-   describe modern uses and techniques for brain stimulation.
