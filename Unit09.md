**Unit 9: Higher Functions** <span id="9"></span> 
*While there are many areas of neuropsychology that remain unexplained,
we know shockingly little about the brain’s ability to control our
higher functions or abilities like learning, memory, language, emotion,
and consciousness. While psychologists classify these abilities as
“nonessential,” since, unlike abilities like breathing or eating, we do
not need them in order to survive, they remain important to our
well-being. This final unit will focus on the different ways in which
the brain controls these behaviors, identifying the problems that result
when these behaviors are not performed.*  
  

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 3 hours

 ☐    Subunit 9.4: 3 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   describe the basic cognitive and neurological processes underlying
    learning and memory;
-   describe the basic cognitive and neurological processes underlying
    language;
