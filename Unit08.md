**Unit 8: Cortical Functions: The Occipital, Parietal, Temporal, and
Frontal Lobes** <span id="8"></span> 
*For the purposes of study, neuropsychologists have divided our brains
not only* *into hemispheres but different “lobes” or areas of the brain
that control specific functions or groups of functions. By understanding
the brain as a set of lobes, psychologists are able to more effectively
discuss patients that have suffered damage to particular areas of the
brain. This is because when apersonsustains damage to an individual
lobe, he* *or she will often suffer damage to a specific system of the
body, like the visual or motor system. This unit will present each of
the lobes and their respective functions and anatomies, identifying
common symptoms that arise when a lobe suffers damage.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 8.4: 3 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   describe the global structure of the cerebrum;
-   define structure and functions of the occipital lobes;
-   define structure and functions of the parietal lobes;
-   define structure and functions of the temporal lobes; and
-   define structure and functions of the frontal lobes.
